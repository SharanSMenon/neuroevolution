# Neuroevolution

My repository of neuroevolution notebooks.

## `tutorials` folder

Any tutorials I write on neuroevolution, I store them there.

## `Experiments` folder

`experimentation/` is a folder of experiments. Not all of them work, but the ones that work will be in `experimentation/success/`. Any experiments that definitely dont work will be in `experimentaiton/failure/`. Other experiments that are in progress or inconclusive will be in `experimentation/`. They will be moved to `experimentation/success/` or `experimentation/failure/` as they complete.
